<p><strong>EFFECTIVE APRIL 16, 2021</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you use LAKE HOP, INC. (&ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, or LAKE HOP), you trust us with your personal data. We&rsquo;re committed to keeping that trust. That starts with helping you understand our privacy practices. &ldquo;Personal Data,&rdquo; means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (each such person, a &ldquo;data subject&rdquo;). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This policy describes the personal data we collect, how it&rsquo;s used and shared, and your choices regarding this data when you access and use the services provided by LAKE HOP (&ldquo;services&rdquo;), included but not limited to the use of our website <a href="https://www.golakehop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">https://www.golakehop.com/</span></a>. It does not cover the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or people that we do not manage. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of any third parties, and we do not control, operate, or endorse any information, products, or services that may be offered by third parties or accessible on or through the Services. <strong>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you</strong>â€‹<strong> acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set out in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</strong></p>

If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Website after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the updated Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>

<li>How We Use Your Data</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use your personal data as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

<p><strong>Account Administration and Provision of Services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use personal data to administer your account, including to verify your identity and to authenticate and authorize access to our Services. For example, we may collect user photographs as an additional security measure for identity verification and fraud-prevention purposes.</p>
<p><strong>BOAT LISTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Services help connect you with potential customers to complete bookings for your boat rental or water experience business that you offer through our Site. To do so, you may choose to publish a listing on our Site with a description of what you offer, and interested customers will send you a booking inquiry via our Site. When customers send you a booking inquiry, you will be able to communicate with each other through LAKE HOP messaging to discuss further details and execute common booking-related actions. Customers can confirm the booking and make a payment through our Site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will use data about you and your listing to help others find your listing, and sometimes to promote your listing and our Services. When a customer confirms a booking with you, we will enable them to contact you through the Site. We will also use your personal data in order to provide payment for a booking for your boat rental or water experience business offering.</p>
<p><strong>BOAT RENTAL</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Services allow you to find and book boat rentals and water experiences. We may use data we have about you and data you provide to show you listings that might match your interests, and we may send details regarding your booking inquiry to listing owners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you request to make a rental or charter via the Services, we will share a link to your LAKE HOP profile page where the owner can view your boating history, reviews, and description/links. All of this information will enable the Owner to decide whether to confirm or reject your booking. When an Owner confirms a booking, we will share the Owner&rsquo;s identity, including, but not limited to, full name and the Boat&rsquo;s location with the applicable Renter. When you confirm a booking, you will be able to contact the listing owner via LAKE HOP messaging. It is up to you to share additional contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Communications and Marketing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LAKE HOP inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We may also send messages about how to use the Services, reminders related to rental or booking inquiries and requests. We may also use your personal information to send you promotional messages from us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may change your communication preferences at any time by visiting the account settings section of the Site. Please be advised that you may not be able to opt-out of receiving certain service or transactional messages from us, including security and legal notices, and communications related to the provision of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Services and Research</strong></p>
<p><strong>SERVICE DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use anonymized data, including public feedback, for analytics purposes and to conduct research and development for the further development and improvement of our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect Owners and Renters to each other and to economic opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use the data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve inquiries, complaints and Service issues.</p>
<p><strong>AGGREGATE INSIGHTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may create de-identified or anonymous data from personal data by removing data components (such as your name, email address, or linkable tracking ID) that makes the data personally identifiable to you or through obfuscation or through other means, including for the purpose of producing and sharing aggregated insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our members and boats on our Services. Our use of anonymized data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>CRIME-PREVENTION AND LEGAL PURPOSES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use your data if we believe in good faith it&rsquo;s necessary for security purposes or to investigate possible fraud or other violations of our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy, and/or attempts to harm our Members or Visitors, and for other legal purposes, such as to comply with applicable laws and respond to legal requests.</p>
<ol>
<li>How We Share Information</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Our Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC USER PROFILE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The information you provide for your public user profile is fully visible to anybody who visits the Site.</p>
<p><strong>LISTINGS AND REVIEWS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Site allows users to view and share personal data, including through listings and reviews. Any data that you include on your public profile and any content you publicly post on our Services may be seen by others.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you create a boat listing, all information you provide in connection with the listing will be publicly viewable, including headline, description, and listing photos.</li>
<li>When you submit a review (e.g., text and photos) publicly on our Site, it can be viewed by the general public. Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We use other third parties to help us provide our Services (e.g., authentication, maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development) as permitted by law. Those third parties may have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf, and they are obligated not to disclose or use your personal data for other purposes. For example, we utilize Stripe to process payment transactions. When you make a purchase, you will be required to provide personal information, together with your payment information. We don&rsquo;t collect or store your payment information on this website&rsquo;s server. Stripe collects the information you enter and stores that information on its website. To learn more about Stripe&rsquo;s policies, you can visit its website <a href="https://stripe.com/us/legal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclosures</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible that we may need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or where we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal or wrongful activities or to assist government agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you or with third parties; (3) investigate and defend our rights and property, including against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services; or (5) exercise or protect the rights and/or safety of LAKE HOP, our Members, personnel, or other third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Change in Control or Sale</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our may continue to use your data only in the manner consistent with this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Rights, Choices &amp; Obligations</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We retain your personal data for as long as you maintain your account, as needed to provide you the Services, or as otherwise required by law. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services, as described in this Privacy Policy. For example, if you use our Services when looking for a boat every few years, we will retain your personal data and keep your profile open in order to provide you the Services until you decide to close your account (as described in the Account Closure section of this Privacy Policy), or otherwise request that we remove your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your boats to advertising opt-outs and communication controls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have the right in certain circumstances to request confirmation from us as to whether or not we are processing your personal data. For personal data that we have about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete Data:</strong>&nbsp;You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).</li>
<li><strong>Change or Correct Data:</strong>&nbsp;You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or correct your data in certain cases, for example, if your information inaccurate.</li>
<li><strong>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data:</strong>&nbsp;You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).</li>
<li><strong>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data:</strong>&nbsp;You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form, or to transmit such data to another controller.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may also exercise your rights by contacting us at the contact information below. As permitted by law, certain data elements may not be subject to access, modification, portability, restriction, and/or deletion. Furthermore, where permissible, we may charge for this service. We will respond to reasonable requests as soon as practicable and as required by law. If you have questions or concerns about these terms, please contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@golakehop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">support@golakehop.com</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Account Closure</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to close your Lake Hop account, please contact our support team at <a href="mailto:support@golakehop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #0000ff;">support@golakehop.com</span></a>Your personal data will generally stop being publicly visible to others on our Site within 72 hours from when we receive your account closure request. We generally delete closed account information from our systems within 30 days of receiving your account closure request, except as noted in this Privacy Policy.</p>

We may retain anonymized information after your account has been closed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that information you have shared with others (e.g., through posting a review on our Site) may remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, so we recommend that you exercise care in deciding what information and content you wish to disclose on the areas of our Site that are accessible to the general public. Review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source of the review. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until those third parties refresh their cache.</p>

<li>Other Important Information</li>
</ol>
